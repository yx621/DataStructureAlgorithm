volatile informs the compiler that the value of the variable can change from outside
without any update done by the code

declare volatile variable
    volatile int x;
    int volatile x;

declare pointer variable for a volatile memory (pointer address is volatile)

    volatiel int *x;
    int volatile *x;

declare volatile pointer variable for a non-volatile memory (memory contained is volatile)

    int *volatile x;

declare volatile variable pointer for a volatile memory (both pointer address and memory are volatile)
    volatile int * volatile x;
    int volatile * volatile x;
