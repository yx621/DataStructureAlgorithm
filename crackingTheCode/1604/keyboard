keyboard send a scan code of the key to the keyboard controller (scan code for key pressed and key released is different)

keyboard controller interprets the scan code and stores it in a buffer

keyboard controller sends a hardware interrupt to the processor. This is done by putting signal on "Interrupt request line": IRQ 1.

Interrupt controller maps IRQ 1 into INT 9

interrupt is a signal tells the processor to stop what is doing currently and do some special task

processor involkes the interrupt controller. CPU fetches the address of "interrupt service routine" (ISR) from interrupt vector table maintained by OS (processor use the IRQ number for this)

ISR reads the scan code from port 60h and decides whether to process it or pass the control to program for taking action
