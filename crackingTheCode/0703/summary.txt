object design is very logical, everything present is object

for the musical juke box
Objects we need to have 
    -- CD (Collection)
    -- User 
    -- CDPlayer
    -- TrackSelector (can select song and return the current song)

For the CD
    -- no more object inside, just it's content is needed
For the Song
    -- (it should have name and duration)
For the CDPlayer
    -- CD
    -- PalyList
    
For the PalyList
    -- Song
    -- SongQueue
