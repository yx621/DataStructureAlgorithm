It's a pretty tricky solution for this pproblem

sort the array by size and putting the longest word in the front

for each word, split it in all possible ways 
    -- test -> {t est} {te st} {tes t} for example
for eacgh pair, check if the first half and the second half both exist in the array
return the word when the previous condition satisfied

//seems we cannot handle the case that word is composed for example 3 words...
